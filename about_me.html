    <h1>Ben Altschuler</h1>
    <p>Last year I went to a surf competition in a small town in central Portugal called Peniche. 
        The weather the first few days was extremely windy, and the ocean looked like a crazy cauldron. 
        By day 3, the weather turned and the ocean had crisp blue lines stretching from the jetty to the sandbank in front of the event site.

    </ul>

    <p>My favorite restaraunt is: <a href="https://aromasperu.com/" target="_blank">Aromas Del Peru</a>. My brother's girlfriend is from Peru, and her family
        introduced us to their amazing cuisine. Peru's food is influenced by Asian, African, and Spanish immigrants, and this restaraunt captures
        it all.

        <p>This picture is the fancy version of my favorite food. I usually leave it in the smoothie maker cup (shoutout Nutribullet).
            I like to blend bananas, yogurt, frozen berries, and spinach. Then I put oats, peanutbutter, and rasins on top!
